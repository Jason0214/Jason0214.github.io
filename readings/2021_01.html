for desktop applications.
Right now, resources are managed to individual processes.
However, applications may spawn different number of processes,
leading to unfairness for high priority but fewer processed applications.<br>

There is no need (yet!) for an address space that large, though, so normally only 48 of those bits are actually used by the hardware — or 52 bits if a special large-address-space option is enabled ... there are 12-16 bits that can be used for other purposes ... The memory tagging extension (MTE) is one of those uses.</p></blockquote> <blockquote><p>MTE allows the storage of a four-bit &quot;key&quot; in bits 59-56 of a virtual address ... Four bits only allow for 16 distinct key values ... If a function like malloc() ensures that allocations that are adjacent in memory have different key values ... Use-after-free bugs can be detected by changing the key value immediately when a range of memory is freed.</p></blockquote> <blockquote><p>MTE thus has two levels of applicability ... If enabled during the normal software-development process, it should help to identify a range of bugs ... it can also be enabled on production systems to add one more obstacle that an attacker must overcome to exploit a known vulnerability.</p></blockquote> <blockquote><p>MTE is disabled by default on Linux systems, even on hardware that supports it. A user-space process can enable MTE for a specific region of memory ... None of this is helpful to anybody now, though, since hardware with MTE support is not actually shipping yet. The good news is that, once that hardware is available, the software side should be ready for it immediately.</p></blockquote> <p>On Arm64, not every 64 bits of a pointer is being used by OS and hardware.
The memory tagging extension uses 4 bits of the unused bits to add a key to a pointer.
It can be used to</p> <ol><li>detect incorrect memory free in development and</li> <li>detect illegal memory dereference issued by attackers.
Though devices supporting MTE haven't been manufactured, the Linux driver for MTE is ready.</li></ol> <h3 id="kernel-support-for-processor-undervolting"><a href="#kernel-support-for-processor-undervolting" class="header-anchor">#</a> Kernel Support for Processor Undervolting</h3> <p><a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/835594/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://lwn.net/Articles/835594/<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg></a> - November 2, 2020</p> <blockquote><p>Current processors can run with any of a number of combinations of frequency and voltage, which can change dynamically in a process called dynamic frequency scaling ...

For sandbox escapes, the GPU offers up a particularly interesting attack surface from the chipset tier. Since GPU acceleration is widely used in applications, the Android sandbox allows full access to the underlying GPU device.</p></blockquote> <blockquote><p>To set up a new shared mapping, the application will ask the KGSL kernel driver for an allocation by calling the IOCTL_KGSL_GPUMEM_ALLOC ioctl. The kernel driver will prepare a region of physical memory, and then map this memory into the GPU's address space ...</p></blockquote> <blockquote><p>Each userland process has its own GPU context, meaning that while a certain application is running operations on the GPU, the GPU will only be able to access mappings that it shares with that process. This is needed so that one application can't ask the GPU to read the shared mappings from another application. In practice this separation is achieved by changing which set of page tables is loaded into the IOMMU whenever a GPU context switch occurs. A GPU context switch occurs whenever the GPU is scheduled to run a command from a different process ... However certain mappings are used by all GPU contexts, and so can be present in every set of page tables. They are called global shared mappings, and are used for a variety of system and debugging functions between the GPU and the KGSL kernel driver.</p></blockquote> <blockquote><p>dump the global mappings (and their GPU virtual addresses) ... scratch buffer has appeared!</p></blockquote> <blockquote><p>two primary usages of the scratch buffer: 1. The GPU address of a preemption restore buffer is dumped to the scratch memory, which appears to be used if a higher priority GPU command interrupts a lower priority command. 2. The read pointer (RPTR) of the ringbuffer (RB) is read from scratch memory and used when calculating the amount of free space in the ringbuffer.</p></blockquote> <blockquote><p>To understand what an invalid RPTR value might mean for a ringbuffer allocation, we first need to describe the ringbuffer itself ... When a userland application submits a GPU command ... The kernel driver will write commands into the ringbuffer, and the GPU will read commands from the ringbuffer ... This occurs in a similar fashion to classical circular buffers ... Two indices are maintained to track where the CPU is writing to (WPTR), and where the GPU is reading from (RPTR).</p></blockquote> <blockquote><p>So what happens if the scratch RPTR value is controlled by an attacker? ... For example, we can make the condition ... succeed when it normally wouldn't by artificially increasing the value of the scratch RPTR, which ... results in returning a portion of the ringbuffer that overlaps the correct RPTR location ... That means that an attacker could overwrite ringbuffer commands that haven't yet been processed by the GPU with incoming GPU commands!</p></blockquote> <blockquote><p>... an attacker cannot modify the scratch buffer directly from their malicious/compromised userland process ... What if we could make the GPU hardware write a malicious RPTR value into the scratch buffer on our behalf? ... It turns out that not every global shared mapping can be written to by user-supplied GPU commands, but the scratch buffer can be ... an attacker can also construct these command sequences manually by setting up some GPU shared memory and calling IOCTL_KGSL_GPU_COMMAND ... CP_MEM_WRITE operation writes a constant value to a GPU address</p></blockquote> <blockquote><p>Now that we know we can reliably control the scratch RPTR value ... what does overwriting it buy us?...</p></blockquote> <blockquote><p>Recall that the ringbuffer is used to send commands from the CPU to the GPU. In practice however, user-supplied GPU commands are never placed directly onto the ringbuffer. This is for two reasons: 1) space in the ringbuffer is limited, and user-supplied GPU commands can be very large, and 2) the ringbuffer is readable by all GPU contexts, and so we want to ensure that one process can't read commands from a different process</p></blockquote> <blockquote><p>a layer of indirection occurs, and user-supplied GPU commands are run after an &quot;indirect branch&quot; from the ringbuffer occurs ... Conceptually system level commands are executed straight from the ringbuffer, and user level commands are run after an indirect branch into GPU shared memory. Once the user commands finish, control flow will return to the next ringbuffer operation. The indirect branch is performed with a CP_INDIRECT_BUFFER_PFE operation, which is inserted into the ringbuffer by adreno_ringbuffer_submitcmd. This operation takes two parameters, the GPU address of the branch target (e.g. a GPU shared memory mapping with user-supplied commands in it) and a size value.</p></blockquote> <blockquote><p>Looking further, it looks like the GPU has the IOMMU's &quot;TTBR0&quot; register mapped to a protected mode GPU register as well. By reading the ARM address translation and IOMMU documentation, we can see that TTBR0 is the base address of the page tables used for translating GPU addresses to physical memory addresses. That means if we can point TTBR0 to a set of malicious page tables, then we can translate any GPU address to any physical address of our choosing ... we could make the GPU switch to an attacker controlled page table ... Not only would our GPU commands be able to read and write shared mappings from other processes, we would be able to read and write to any physical address in memory, including kernel memory!</p></blockquote> <p>A well explained exploitation on Android that uses Adreno GPU to achieve kernel code execution.
The article gives an excellent introduction on how CPU dispatches commands to GPU using RingBuffer and ScratchBuffer.
And how a few tampering on ScratchBuffer and IOMMU register fools the GPU to read commands from a malicious controlled page.</p> <h3 id="let-s-build-a-high-performance-fuzzer-with-gpus"><a href="#let-s-build-a-high-performance-fuzzer-with-gpus" class="header-anchor">#</a> Let’s Build a High-performance Fuzzer with GPUs!</h3> <p><a href="https://blog.trailofbits.com/2020/10/22/lets-build-a-high-performance-fuzzer-with-gpus/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://blog.trailofbits.com/lets-build-a-high-performance-fuzzer-with-gpus<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg></a> - October 22, 2020</p> <h3 id="using-tla-in-the-real-world-to-understand-a-glibc-bug"><a href="#using-tla-in-the-real-world-to-understand-a-glibc-bug" class="header-anchor">#</a> Using TLA+ in the Real World to Understand a Glibc Bug</h3> <p><a href="https://probablydance.com/2020/10/31/using-tla-in-the-real-world-to-understand-a-glibc-bug/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://probablydance.com/using-tla-in-the-real-world<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg></a> - October 31, 2020</p></div></div> <footer class="page-edit"><!----> <div class="last-updated"><span class="prefix">Last Updated by lujc:</span> <span class="time">2/21/2021, 3:57:55 AM</span></div></footer> <!----> </main></div><div class="global-ui"></div></div>
