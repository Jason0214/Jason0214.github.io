Connect the boxes ... Lift the state up ... Introduce a message bus... It goes without saying, that none of the presented options are without problems.</blockquote><blockquote><p>Connect the boxes: ... It turns out, for small components this strategy works quite well. As usual, it’s often the wrong thing to do when your project grows large and contains hundreds of such inter class communication paths. Not to mention how injecting hundreds of components is tedious, error prone and ugly to look at.</blockquote><blockquote><p>Lift the state up: ... handling this accidental complexity is by lifting the state up and storing the state of your component into another box that is usually called the model ... Model View Controller (MVC) gang rejoice ... though you improved the situation a little bit, you still have a huge model that is full of weird edge cases... The more modern GUI frameworks usually arm you with some kind of data binding abstraction, which allows to easily propagate data changes from one model to another via the so called one way, two way data binding ... you realize that it would be really useful if you could attach a change listener that would trigger and perform an action on every change of the state object ... Clicking on buttons will start triggering events which will modify the state in the model that will in turn start triggering event listeners causing your GUI to flash like a christmas tree ...</blockquote><blockquote><p>Message bus: ... just spamming messages back and forth causes a lot of performance problems ... Why filter out all the irrelevant messages and waste CPU cycles, when you can subscribe to a specific channel that receives only the messages on the topic you are interested in? ... But, it’s so easy to throw yet another message into the void.</blockquote><blockquote><p>There is also another way of making GUIs called Immediate Mode that is commonly used for drawing user interfaces in games ... Immediate Mode GUIs somehow never reached the critical mass and you are probably not going to find it outside of the games industry.</blockquote><p>A good discussion on the complexity in developing GUI, especiall in the unavoidable cross component communication. Three commonly used design pattern are discussed here. 1) creates ad-hoc links works; but it does not scale 2) MVC design can scale, still the data bindings (intra component links) can get very complex 3) Message bus (i.e. publish/subscribe) is a good abstraction, but it either waste cycles on filtering irrelevant message or being error prone on finding the right subscriber. From my own experience, I have the same feeling as the author that immediate mode GUI like ImGui has fewer issues.<h3 id=cameras-and-lenses>Cameras and Lenses<a aria-label="Anchor link for: cameras-and-lenses" class=zola-anchor href=#cameras-and-lenses><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a></h3><p><a href=https://ciechanow.ski/cameras-and-lenses/>https://ciechanow.ski/cameras-and-lenses/</a><p>Long article but relaxing to read.

Wine on Wayland is very interesting as it may bring lots of GPU heavy games onto Wayland. While previously, games running on Wayland needs to go through XWayland. Being able to get rid of X, it might be an opportunity for us to see how Wayland are capable of running games, like performance wise.<h3 id=explanation-of-the-linux-kernel-memory-consistency-model>Explanation of the Linux-Kernel Memory Consistency Model<a aria-label="Anchor link for: explanation-of-the-linux-kernel-memory-consistency-model" class=zola-anchor href=#explanation-of-the-linux-kernel-memory-consistency-model><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a></h3><p><a href=https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/tools/memory-model/Documentation/explanation.txt>https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/tools/memory-model/Documentation/explanation.txt</a><p>Best explanation of various memory models, cache coherence, etc that I ever read.
